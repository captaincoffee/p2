M-E flexible pavement design procedures have evolved since the late 50‘s and early 60’s.  In the analyses of the AASHO Road Test data, it was demonstrated that pavement response (surface deflection) was a good indicator of pavement performance (equally as good as the Structural Number). Significant advances have been achieved in the last 50+ years. Current procedures and developments for materials characterization, structural modeling, distress transfer functions, and other issues are considered in the presentation. Emphases are placed on those concepts/approaches that support the development of readily usable/implementable flexible  pavement design procedures.
